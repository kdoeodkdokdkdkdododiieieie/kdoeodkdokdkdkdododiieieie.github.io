# Hey there!
I am a dude from Vietnam. My birthday is on the September 7th. During my free time, I like writing and listening to indie music.
I enjoy watching animes, reading mangas, (open-world) games and eating Pho. Games include Minecraft, Among Us and all that stuff.

* I'm an introvert. More specifically, **😼 ISTP-T**
* ✏️ I sketch and write.
* ☠️ I'm **funny** (sometimes)
* 🤓 I hate the `Sound's World` server.
* 💥 I [collect comics](/wip)
