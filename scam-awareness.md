A bot will DM you saying you just got Free Nitro.

NOTE**: Discord will never DM you if they want to give you Free Nitro. If they do, they'd tweet about it on [their official twitter account](https://twitter.com/Discord) or put it in the `Nitro` tab.

People would typically click on the "Claim" button and it'll ask you to authorize an app. The app would most likely have these permissions: "`Know your email address`" or "`Join servers for you`".

Once you authorize the app, it might add you to random servers, or email you random garbage.

If you accidentally authorized the app, do the following:
* Go to User Settings → Authorized Apps
* Deauthorize everything with the "Join servers for you"
* Deauthorize everything with the "Access your email address"
* Check if you joined any random servers

######  
  You just got a DM or a message in a server asking you to join a server offering you jobs or a free-NSFW server. Those servers will ask you to "verify" to be able to access the server. They will use a well-known service called "Captcha-bot". Except that is not the actual Captcha Bot! It is a fake bot impersonating the real one.

  In most cases, it will ask you to login via your Discord account. Except you're not logging into Discord.com, you're sending your Discord account credentials to some random person on the internet.

**NOTE**: PLEASE look at the link of the site that you're logging into. If you wish to learn more about these scams, feel free to click [here](https://docs.captcha.bot/reference/phishing-scams) to be redirected to Captcha.bot's Help Article.

So, if you fell for it:
1. Go to User Settings
2. Change your Passsword
3. Reset Backup codes
4. Check if you sent any messages or DMs with an invite link promoting the server. If your account did send these invite links, tell the people you sent it to that it is a scam.
5. Turn on [Multi Factor Authentication](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Multi-Factor-Authentication)

Side-note, if you're really downbad and you want to see tits, just use google :)

  <summary>"I Reported You" Discord Scam</summary>

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5415d437-b467-43f0-a003-689677676d4b)

_Source: NTTS YT channel. The image shows a fake Discord support scammer._
######  
The scam goes as follows: one of your friends (that is hacked) will DM you saying they filed reports on your account accidentally, then ask you to DM a Discord staff member to get your account unbanned. Well, **IT'S A SCAM.**

If anyone on Discord sends you a DM (direct message) stating that your account has been reported by accident, it's a scam.

If Discord wants to contact you, it's going to be through a system message. A system message looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73ce30bd-a45d-4db0-9e09-f3c06a93fc55)

The account has the Discord Staff [![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/02e30092-45ab-4164-ac89-b0af50839f73)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035962891-Profile-Badges-101#h_01GM67MNYEVR6445C38JC4V3DS) badge. It also shows "![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2df8eb-a5da-4eca-a083-4e95d72fcdf5)" next to the name and you cannot talk in the DM.

NOTE**: Do not change any settings in your profile, including your email or password. If you change your email to their email, they can request a password change to the email that they own, which gives your account to the hacker.
