You're curious? Okay, here's some more stuff about me. My Wumpus Platform user is [`kodiebtw`](https://discord.com/users/1112373063296753766). My friend requests are open if you're a friend of a friend or if you share a mutual server with me.

If you want to talk about literally anything, you can DM me! A very basic thing is please check out [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en) and [dontasktoask.com](https://dontasktoask.com/en/). Just don't send me anything NSFW/NSFL. If you want to contact me via something else, you can go [here](/contact-me). Yes, I use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kodiebtw) for memes and cool stuff.

**Random Facts time.** I recently aquired a Blahaj. I like listening to [Inabakumori](https://open.spotify.com/artist/25b7eSZD64Sm8ReHZ1WDc7).
