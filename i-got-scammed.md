## I got "Free" ![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/c083049e-3d03-4931-b47f-0b9c8cfb2763)

A bot will DM you saying you just got Free Nitro.

NOTE**: Discord will never DM you if they want to give you Free Nitro. If they do, they'd tweet about it on their official twitter account or put it in the nitro tab.

People would typically click on the "Claim" button and it'll ask you to authorize an app. The app would most likely have these permissions: "`Know your email address` or `Join servers for you`".

Once you authorize the app, it might add you to random servers, or email you random garbage.

If you accidentally authorized the app, do the following:
* Go to User Settings → Authorized Apps
* Deauthorize everything with the "Join servers for you"
* Deauthorize everything with the "Access your email address"
* Check if you joined any random servers

## "I reported you" ![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/20f4cd28-1e96-419e-a181-b3bc3629d5d7)/![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/980c49e9-4754-4ce2-91d3-0dabf7476f92)  Scam
The scam goes as follows: one of your friends (that is hacked) will DM you saying they filed reports on your account accidentally, then ask you to DM a Discord staff member to get your account unbanned. Well, **IT'S A SCAM.**

If anyone on Discord sends you a DM (direct message) stating that your account has been reported by accident, it's a scam.

* I don't really know much about Steam, so I'll give you this [support link](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3195-9FFB-BA06-F25B)
  * Don't login to any site that isn't https://store.steampowered.com.

If Discord wants to contact you, it's going to be through a system message. A system message looks like this:

The account has the Discord Staff [![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/02e30092-45ab-4164-ac89-b0af50839f73)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035962891-Profile-Badges-101#h_01GM67MNYEVR6445C38JC4V3DS) badge.

NOTE**: Do not change any settings in your profile, including your email or password.

## NSFW/Job ![image](https://github.com/bobbledbobby/bobbledbobby.github.io/assets/154967011/20f4cd28-1e96-419e-a181-b3bc3629d5d7) Server scam

You just got a DM or a message in a server asking you to join a server offering you jobs or NSFW.
 * **![image](https://github.com/kodedkodie/kodedkodie.github.io/assets/154967011/9280d93c-824d-4d5c-8234-7e398c15d462)
NOTE**: PLEASE look at the link of the site that you're logging into. If you wish to learn more about these scams, feel free to click [here](https://docs.captcha.bot/reference/phishing-scams) to be redirected to Captcha.bot's Help Article.

So, if you fell for it:
* Go to User Settings
* Change your Passsword
* Reset Backup codes
* Check if you sent any messages or DMs with an invite link promoting the server. If your account did send these invite links, tell them it's a scam.
* Turn on 2FA
