# Demote the Co-Owner of No Text To Speech, Lavernie.
NOTE THIS ONLY APPLIES TO USERS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN THE NO TEXT TO SPEECH COMMUNITY.
###### ‎ 
We are asking for one of our co-owners of the No Text To Speech server, Lavernie to be demoted. It’s no surprise that when you give someone Administrator perms, they can either use it respectfully and responsibly or just use it to cause drama for your own entertainment. We can already check one off the list.
