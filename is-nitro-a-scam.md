## Is Discord Nitro a Scam?

A lot of people have been begging for Nitro, as if it's your only resource to live & saying "is discord nitro a scam!?11!??" so today, I'll answer that question.


All of this is speculation. This is _my_ opinion.

Note this thing is inspired by SoundDrout and NTTS on YT.

### Can you afford it?
Discord Nitro is $10 & $3 for Nitro Basic.

If you're 14, and living off a budget, then it's prob in your best interest to not buy nitro.
However, if you are working and you have a paying job, and, you do actually care about Discord, you may buy Discord Nitro.

### What would Discord do?
Discord, as a tech company can easily run out of money. They can do one of three things:
1. Sell your data
2. Put random sponsored ads in the platform (nitro ads does not include)
3. Promote Discord Nitro/microtransactions

In the scenario when Discord runs out of money, they'll be forced to do one of the above! Let's play a game. Would you rather:
1. Have your birthdate, email & personal info (and possibly your ID if you appealed your ban for being underage)
2. Have ads in the platform for Discord Nitro

### It's a ripoff
Do you think $3 is worth custom emojis??? Pixels on a chat platform is not worth $3. It might be worth it to you if you make hundred of dollars, then $3 might be nothing to you, but to be honest, it's not really worth it.

However for $10, you can get bigger file sharing, 500MB to be exact. You can also have HD Streaming, a profile effect and discounts for the Shop microtransactions.

### Server Boosts
Server Boosts are worth $5. So what do you get for $5? I will list the stuff that will actually interest nitro users.
* Level 1 ($10)
  1. Emoji/Stickers slots
  2. 128 Kbps audio quality
  3. Streams at 720P 60FPS
* Level 2 ($35)
  1. 256 Kbps audio quality
  2. Streams to 1080P 60FPS
  3. 50MB Upload Limit
  4. Emoji/Stickers slots
* Level 3 ($70)
  1. Emoji/Sticker slots
  2. 384Kbps audio quality
  3. Animated Server Banner
  
 But wait, you don't need to pay 35 dollars for Nitro streaming quality! If seven people pay $5 or 10 people pay $3, you can get 1080P 60FPS streaming quality.
 Or, you don't even have to do anything. A typical server (assuming you have streaming perms) are boosted to level 1-2, and if they have streaming events, you can stream 1080P 60FPS quality!

 ### NQN
 You can use the NQN bot by adding the bot to a server and it'll send a webhook in your name and PFP, with the custom emoji.

 ## So what's the conclusion????
 No, Discord Nitro is *not* a scam. However it can be pricey. So you can buy it if you actually care about your privacy and the company overall. However if you are young and do not have a lot of money, then don't buy nitro.
